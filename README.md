The Persona 3 Party Skill Editor is a program with two purposes:
-It can restore any changes made to party member skills by mods or cheats
-It can prepare a save file for use with the New Moon balance patch, by giving party members the skills they should have

The program works like this:
-First, it asks what the intention of the user is (for unmodded P3 or for New Moon)
-Second, it aks for the game played (Journey or Answer)
-Third, it asks for the level of each party member (and if Junpei has Spring of Life if he is selected)

The program will then spit out a cheat code document, containing the skills that each party member should have at the level provided in the
game provided for the type provided.

It may sound complicated but it is really straight-forward on your end.

Instructions:
-Drag Party_Skill_Editor.py into a command prompt window
-Follow the instructions given by the program
-Drag the created cheat code folder into your cheat code loader of choice (for PCSX2 it's the cheats folder)
